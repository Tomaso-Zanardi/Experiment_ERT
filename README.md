# Experiment_ERT
It is the script of an experiment that we ran for the class "Emprical Research Training" (ERT).
The course is part of the School of Mind and Brain Master's degree program, and it was given by Dr. Professor Marcel Brass, Silvia Formica Ph.D, and Carl Michael Galang Ph.D.

## Experiment

The .py script is a behavioral experiment in python that uses the PsychoPy libarary and is aimed at testing approach/avoidance biases.

the indipendent variables (IV) are:

1) **mapping**: there are two blocks; *natural mapping* and *unnatural mapping*.
   In the natural mapping subjects are asked to approach happy faces and avoid angry ones, while in the unnatural mapping the instructions are reversed.
2) **group action**: other than the stimulus image, one avatar representing the subject and other avatars are present at the bottom of the screen. in some trials the avatars move toward the stimulus other times they move away from it. Therefore, sometimes the avatars perform the same (congruent) action as the participant, sometimes they perform the opposite action (incongruent).

the dipendent variables (IV) are:

1) **RTs**
2) **ERs**
